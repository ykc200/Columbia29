This is a game(ish) I have been working on.
 
The purpose is to get myself used to programming in c# and how to use unity.
 
The ultimate objective is to make it a pvp game with abilities and such.

About the game:
This game is kinda like rock paper scissors, execpt we have square triangle and circles.
 
Squares can fire bullets, triangles are melee based, and circles can reflect things(including melee).
 
Players are required to perform highly skilled maneuvers in order to win.


The Controls for now:
  WASD to move 
   
  Space to shoot (square mode only)
   
  Use mouse to aim and rotate
   
  Q and E to change shapes
   
  Right-click to reflect
